    <strong>Deep RL-Based Optimal Control of 6-DoF Autonomous Underwater Vehicles</strong>  
    <br>
    During my research at MST, I developed a reinforcement learning-based control framework for ensuring safe and optimal adaptive tracking of 6-DoF AUVs. The approach integrates an MNN-based actor-critic framework with backstepping techniques to solve the HJB equation, enabling optimal control policy derivation while ensuring real-time safety.
    A novel Barrier Function (BF) and Control Barrier Function (CBF) were introduced to guide AUV trajectories safely, preventing violations of operational constraints. To enhance long-term learning and mitigate catastrophic forgetting in multi-task scenarios, an Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC)-based regularization method was applied. Additionally, a hybrid learning technique improved the convergence rate of the reinforcement learning model.
    The proposed framework was rigorously validated through simulations, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving stability, safety, and adaptability for AUVs navigating dynamic and uncertain environments.
