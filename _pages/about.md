# About Me

I am currently a **Ph.D. candidate** at [Missouri University of Science and Technology (MST)](https://www.mst.edu/) in the **Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering**, under the guidance of **Dr. Sarangapani**.  

My research focuses on **reinforcement learning-based optimal tracking control** for **nonlinear discrete-time systems**, with applications in **robotics and autonomous vehicles**. A significant aspect of my work is **lifelong learning-based optimal controllers**, where the controller continuously learns from past experiences to enhance future performance. I also emphasize **safety-aware and explainable AI**, ensuring the **reliability and interpretability** of autonomous decision-making systems.  

Beyond my core research, I explore **machine learning applications in cyber-physical systems**, including:
- **Vision-based robotic manipulation and localization**
- **Motion planning & perception**
- **SLAM and mapping for real-world autonomous navigation**

## **Academic Background & Research Initiatives**  

I earned my **M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering** from **Amirkabir University of Technology**, specializing in **distributed optimal control for power systems**. My thesis focused on **developing advanced control strategies for power networks**, optimizing system performance through **mathematical modeling and distributed control techniques**.

During my time at **Amirkabir University**, I worked on several projects in ** NN-based optimal control and state estimation of Surface Effect Ships **, designing **robust controllers for smart grids and shipboard power systems (SPS)**. 
My passion for **advanced control and autonomy** led me to pursue further studies at **Missouri University of Science and Technology, USA**, where my research focuses on **reinforcement learning-based optimal control** for **nonlinear, multitasking systems**. My work involves developing **safe, explainable AI-driven controllers** for:
- **Autonomous Marine Vessels**
- **Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) & Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)**
- **Robotic Platforms**

These controllers ensure **adaptive and efficient decision-making** in **uncertain environments**.
